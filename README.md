# Techdegree Project
 Project 2 for Treehouse Full Stack Techdegree

 I am going for an exceeds grade.  Please reject if this project does not meet exceeds.

 ## Overview
 This is a browser-based example of a List Pagination and Filtering website built with JavaScript.

 The webpage displays a list of 9 students (names, photos, email addresses, date joined) at a time.  It has a navigation system (series of links) at the bottom of the page.  The navigation links allow the user to click through 9 students at a time.  The code will work with any size list of students.

 ## Extra Credit
 Added a search function that allows students to be searched by name.

 The search function displays a message if no name is found.  The students listed on the screen dynamically update as letters are typed (or the submit button is pressed).  Page Links are updated according to the number of students that match the search text.  An empty search resets the list to the first page.
